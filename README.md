# WordPress2KnownStatus

A test plugin to figure out how to post statuses to a known site.

My first attempt a a wordpress plugin.
Should post a status update to a [known](http://withknown.com) site using the known api.

I am really putting this up as a cry for help.
I'd like to be able to have a meta-box of the post pages, perhaps with a checkbox to confirm sending to known and to reflect whatever known sends back (A link perhaps?)

I am not sure where to start with that...

Also I am use there is a bunch of standard stuff or good practise I've missed out.
