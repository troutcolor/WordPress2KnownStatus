# WordPress2KnownStatus

A test plugin to figure out how to post statuses to a known site.

My first attempt a a WordPress plugin.
Should post a status update to a [known](http://withknown.com) site using the known api.

I am really putting this up as a cry for help. There are a few things I'd like to be able to do:

* I'd like to be able to have a meta-box of the post pages, perhaps with a checkbox to confirm sending to known and to reflect whatever known sends back (A link perhaps?)
* Alert users if plugin is active but no settings
* Do something better than fail silently in above case

I am not sure where to start with that...

Also I am use there is a bunch of standard stuff or good practice I've missed out.

## Installation 

I just put the folder into wp-contents/plugins/ via ftp 
then activated in the plugins.
You need to fill in the settings
